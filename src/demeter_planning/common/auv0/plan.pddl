- Duration of (harvest-energy vehicle0) is not constant-bounded
Non-constant-bounded duration-dependent effect ((battery-level vehicle0) +=10.000*?duration) makes effects on 0 be order-dependent
Pruning (retrieve-data vehicle0 data5 waypoint22 currenttide turbine5) - temporal contradiction: start min/max = 9223372036854776.000/22307.299; end min/max = 20.000/22327.299; duration min/max = 20.000/20.000
